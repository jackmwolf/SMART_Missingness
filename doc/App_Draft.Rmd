Our app allows users to simulate data from a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) with varying missingness scenarios and evaluate the performance of multiple imputation in estimating the mean response of a given treatment regime across three study visits.  
Full details are available within the "About" page of the app.

The app is available through [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) at
[jackmwolf.shinyapps.io/SMART_Missingness_Simulator/](https://jackmwolf.shinyapps.io/SMART_Missingness_Simulator/) and the associated code and files can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/) at
